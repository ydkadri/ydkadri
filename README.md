## Youcef Kadri

I have worked across statistical analytics, digital forensics, software, and operations. I am always looking for a new challenge and data consulting has provided that to me for the majority of my career.

I feel like I know [Python][python_url], I am learning [Rust][rust_url], and I never want to see [Fortran][fortran_url] again.

> I'm currently learning about security and privacy, and how I can leverage my analytics skills in this space.

You can find me on [LinkedIn][social_linkedin], writing on [Medium][social_medium], or roaming the streets of [Wellington NZ][social_welly]
