## Youcef Kadri

I have worked across statistical analytics, digital forensics, software, and operations. I am always looking for a new challenge and data consulting has provided that to me for the majority of my career.

I feel like I know [Python](https://www.python.org/), I am learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and I never want to see [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) again.

> I'm currently learning about security and privacy, and how I can leverage my analytics skills in this space.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youcefk/) or roaming the streets of [Wellington NZ](https://goo.gl/maps/9Ga6bEWXxQujNXjY9)
